// A key step in processing the log is merging multiple logs into one. To accomplish this each widget
// must provide the capabililty to merge multiple instances of the widget into one. This requires
// three component:
// - a mapping from the names of widgets ("specified when adding the widget's key->value pairs in setProperties())
//   to a function that determines whether a given set of instances of a given widget are compatible with each other
//   and therefore may be merged. This is done by BoxMerger::mergeKey().
// - a mapping to the functions that perform the merging. This is done by BoxMergeHandlerInstantiator, which maps "box" to a 
//   function that creates a Merger object, the constructor of which merges multiple instances of a given widget.
//   The procedure for this is very similar to the way objects are serialized inside their normal constructors.
//   He inheritance hierarchy of Merger objects (Merger::BlockMerger::BoxMerger) mirrors that of the regular objects
//   (sightObj::block::box). At the starting point (call to the most derived constructor) we start with multiple 
//   properties objects, each of which contains a sequence of key->value mappings for all the classes in the object's
//   inheritance hierarchy. The mappings are ordered according to their creation order (first box, then block, then sightObj),
//   so the call to the most derived constructor is given an iterator to the first mapping in each object, which 
//   must be the one that the constructor for its object (box::box()) set up. It then processes these mappings and 
//   adds to a new properties object a mapping that describes the merged object. Finally, the constructor calls its 
//   parent constructor with the partially-completed merge properties object and with iterators to the input properties
//   objects that have been advanced by one step. The parent constructor repeats the procedure for its own key->value
//   pairs but instead of creating a new merged properties object, adds to the one that is given to it.

// This object registers a handler for label "box" that determine whether multiple box objects are compatible for merging
// (BoxMerer::mergeKey) and a handler that creates an instance of the BoxMerger class that performs the merge (BoxMerger::create).
